## Project Description
This simple daily planner application allows users to input hourly events using Javascript to dynamically allocate CSS and HTML.
## Usage
To test and showcase my knowledge of Javascript.
## Test Instructions
Input schedule information into one of the hour timeslots. Grey timeslots are past hour events, red are current hour events and green are future hour events. Once you have written info into a timeslot, save text to local storage using the save icon to the right of the text.
